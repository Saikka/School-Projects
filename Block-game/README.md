# Block-game

This is a simple game where each level floor is randomly generated from blocks of different color. Each level there is only one color which is safe and the goal is to move character to the correct block in time. Floor is growing with the time and amount of colors also grows. At some point there are balls which on the floor which are randomly spawned and they give speed boost to the character. Characted model was taken from the internet, everything else is done by myself including game logic, light and camera control.
